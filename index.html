  █▓                                                                       ▓█
 █▓                                                                         ▓█
█▓   I was barely 13 years old when I watched the world panic and struggle   ▓█
█▓   to prepare for the first global information catastrophe in history,     ▓█
█▓   Y2K. The inevitable disaster that never came still taught an            ▓█
█▓   invaluable, formative, lesson: Society is deeply reliant on computers   ▓█
█▓   and networks and a single software bug could have a devastating global  ▓█
█▓   impact. No government or military in the world could stop Y2K and that  ▓█
█▓   demonstrated to me the sheer power of code and it's ability to be       ▓█
█▓   exploited.                                                              ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Before long I obtained a free dial-up account and found myself          ▓█
█▓   frequenting 'H/P/V/C/A/' webrings. The concept of 'illegal              ▓█
█▓   information' was absolutely fascinating to me. There were text-files    ▓█
█▓   for any illicit computer or telephony act you could think of, for       ▓█
█▓   educational purposes of course (textfiles.org). Tools like AIM bots,    ▓█
█▓   booters, flooders and 'warscripts' were more fun than any video game.   ▓█
█▓   In fact, this wasn't a game at all, it was real life with real          ▓█
█▓   consequences.                                                           ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   I spent years learning the basics of breaking and repairing computers   ▓█
█▓   and soon Napster would become a global phenomenon. Napster wasn't just  ▓█
█▓   a revolutionary P2P program though; Napster was a person (Shawn         ▓█
█▓   Fanning), a username and an important member of one of my favorite      ▓█
█▓   hacking groups, w00w00. That same year, 'China Eagle Union' (Wan Tao)   ▓█
█▓   hacked Whitehouse.gov and placed a Chinese flag on the homepage,        ▓█
█▓   practically without consequence. It became abundantly clear to me that  ▓█
█▓   new era of (public) cyber-war was dawning before my eyes. This was      ▓█
█▓   evidence again that hackers can and will change the world               ▓█
█▓   drastically.                                                            ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Warez boards, IRC chans, FXP rushing and the underground world of       ▓█
█▓   piracy exposed me to the art and challenge of subverting software       ▓█
█▓   security. Soon I'd complete my first 'crackme' and write my very own    ▓█
█▓   keygen for a commercial product. I never even used the software;        ▓█
█▓   cracking it was a merely a means to an end, an opportunity to really    ▓█
█▓   understand the ins-and-outs.                                            ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Midway through high school my path became clear: understand how to      ▓█
█▓   wield the formidable power of computer systems and learn how to         ▓█
█▓   protect them from attack. I had already been remediating malware for    ▓█
█▓   4+ years and was ready for much more. Soon I was driving 2 hours to     ▓█
█▓   the Houston 2600 meeting at Ninfa's, where I'd be exposed to a world    ▓█
█▓   of eggdrop servers, BNCs, and the infamous 'vim escape' privilege       ▓█
█▓   escalation. These were 'real' hackers. Compared to them, I knew         ▓█
█▓   nothing and I knew it. Nothing could've been more inspirational.        ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Phrack, Packetstorm and SecurityFocus became my new religion. John      ▓█
█▓   Perry Barlow's 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'        ▓█
█▓   (1996) and The Mentor's 'The Conscience of a Hacker' became the         ▓█
█▓   bedrock of my Internet philosophy. ‘The Cuckoo’s Egg’ and               ▓█
█▓   redacted reports of MOONLIGHT MAZE, OP SUNDEVIL and the like became my  ▓█
█▓   history books. Incantations of "cheddar_bay.sh",                        ▓█
█▓   "jessica_biel_naked_in_my_bed.c", "vmsplice()" and "ptrace/kmod"        ▓█
█▓   allowed me to explore hitherto unimaginable places online.              ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Countless nights and mornings were spent buried in the depths of        ▓█
█▓   shadowy IRC channels and foreign language hacker boards. I was          ▓█
█▓   consuming text files from former hacker generations at a feverish,      ▓█
█▓   insatiable, rate. I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered       ▓█
█▓   ZF0's lurid publications of rapacious pwnage and spoolz. Life online    ▓█
█▓   was becoming further and further abstracted. I've always had a very     ▓█
█▓   active life offline, but the world of the green and black terminal was  ▓█
█▓   exciting, always promising new challenges and unexpected antiheros.     ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   In college I discovered David Chalmers’s 'The Extended Mind' (1998),    ▓█
█▓   his seminal work in the field of extended cognition, which holds that   ▓█
█▓   the reach of the mind need not end at the boundaries of skin and        ▓█
█▓   skull. 'Tools, instrument and other environmental props can under       ▓█
█▓   certain conditions also count as proper parts of our minds.' The        ▓█
█▓   implications of this are hard to overstate. The epistemological         ▓█
█▓   difference between knowing something 'by heart' and being able to call  ▓█
█▓   it up online in a matter of seconds was quickly vanishing. Mastery of   ▓█
█▓   the Internet was a crucial step to extending my mind as far and as      ▓█
█▓   wide as possible.                                                       ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Now I've worked in IT for over fifteen years, doing everything from     ▓█
█▓   crawling in ceilings to run Ethernet, automation scripting with Python  ▓█
█▓   and Bash, virtualizing datacenters, analyzing malware, scouring pcaps,  ▓█
█▓   sysadmining, more sysadmining, gathering threat intelligence & OSINT,   ▓█
█▓   deploying honeypots and deception technology, disaster recovery,        ▓█
█▓   incident response, penetration testing, CNA/CNO/CND and just about      ▓█
█▓   every type of offense and defense in between.                           ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   My clients, customers and employers have ranged from the financial      ▓█
█▓   sector, higher education, healthcare, law, high-tech and span from      ▓█
█▓   startups to SMBs to Fortune 5s.                                         ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   Regardless of what I'm working on, security is always the focal point.  ▓█
█▓   It is a mindset.                                                        ▓█
█▓                                                                           ▓█
█▓   If you only play one position, you don't know the whole game.           ▓█
 █▓                                                                         ▓█
